# dataset_covid_19_symptoms
Dataset of symptoms exhibited by Covid-19 patients

The original dataset has been taken from https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared

Only patient entries that contained data on symptoms were extracted. Symptoms shown by the patients were categorized into the most common symptoms. Last row in the dataset shows percentage of the common symptoms occurence across this population.

I will be updating this dataset as more data comes in.

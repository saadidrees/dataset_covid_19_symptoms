# dataset_covid_19_symptoms
Dataset of symptoms exhibited by Covid-19 patients

The original dataset has been taken from https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared

The dataset was cleaned to pull records of patients with symptom data. Whether the patient exhibited one of the symptoms is shown as a binary value. This should help data scientists to play around with symptoms data.
